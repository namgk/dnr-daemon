** Update: dnr-daemon has been incorporated into *node-red-contrib-dnr* for a Distributed cluster of Node-RED. This standalone application can be used to interact with Node-RED's flow and node API. For example to get a flow, get all flows, install a flow, delete a flow, as well as get all installed nodes (yes, there are some overlapping functionality with *node-red-admin*). 

Usage: 

$ npm run start <getflows|getflow|installflow|uninstallflow|getnodes|target>
